# Simple-Spaceship-Game
A relatively simple spaceship game I made by following and then adding on to Shawn Spaulding's GameMaker tutorial (either this one:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPRT_JORnIurFYwHdWhLWR3bLH2nzChsm or this one:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPRT_JORnIuo-DyoWbB7LBrhqlJnsltJq I don't remember).

I started this when I was in high school and did most of the development during that time, but I have added a few things since then and might add more in the future.  Like I said earlier, I started out following a tutorial but asI went along I started adding more and more of my own ideas until it became closer to its own thing.  As it is now, you can move around all over the screen with wasd (I still can't decide if it's better for the controls to be set or based on the direction the ship is pointing towards), the ship will point towards your mouse cursor and you can fire wrenches (I switched the normal projectile to wrenches when I was testing projectiles for a game jam game and forgot to switch it back) by pressing space.  It isn't actually much of a game and it doesn't do anything too interesting, but I wanted to put all my code into the world and maybe you'll find some of this stuff helpful or interesting.
